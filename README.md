## Description

Welcome to my Portfolio! This application was built using React, one of the latest front-end frameworks. React incorporates a virtual dom for partial rendering of the application. With a new framework, comes a learning curve for trying to understand. A challenge that I have stumbled upon was passing information between reusable code called components. In order to do this, I had to incorporate code called 'props'. Props are used to pass information between components. Besides this challenge, much of the struggle came from reading and understanding the documentation. After creating this application, I have become more familiar with how React works.
